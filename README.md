## How to use upwork BOT

Hi Bowingman!

I have check your source code.

It is great solution for freelancer.

Thanks for your work.

But i am sorry, could you explain more detail how to use?

There is no config file.

And i am not expert of Python.

So i hope you explain usage step by step with screenshot like as https://github.com/Upwork-Assistant/Upwork-Account-Making-Bot.

Looking forward to your next commit

Thanks again
